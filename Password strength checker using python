You can create a password strength checker using Python. A very basic password strength checker would ensure that the password meets the following criteria:

At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
At least 1 number between [0-9].
At least 1 character from [$#@].
Minimum length of 6 characters and a maximum length of 16 characters.
Here is a simple Python function that implements these rules:

python
Copy code
import re 

def password_check(password): 
    # Calculating the length 
    if (len(password) < 6 or len(password) > 16): 
        return "Password length must be between 6 and 16 characters"
  
    # Searching for digits 
    elif not re.search("[0-9]", password): 
        return "Password must contain at least one number"
  
    # Searching for uppercase 
    elif not re.search("[A-Z]", password): 
        return "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
  
    # Searching for lowercase 
    elif not re.search("[a-z]", password): 
        return "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter"
  
    # Searching for symbols 
    elif not re.search("[#$@]", password): 
        return "Password must contain at least one special character #$@"
  
    # If all conditions are met 
    else: 
        return "Password is strong"

# Test the function
print(password_check("Test@123"))  # Should print "Password is strong"
This script uses Python's re module, which provides support for regular expressions. The re.search() function scans through the given string, looking for any location where the regular expression pattern produces a match.

Please note, this is a very simple password strength checker. A more sophisticated tool could check for other things such as common passwords, repeated characters, sequential numbers, and more.
