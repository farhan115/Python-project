Here is a simple port scanner script written in Python using the built-in socket library:

python
Copy code
import socket

def scan_ports(host):
    open_ports = []
    for port in range(1, 65535):
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        result = sock.connect_ex((host, port))
        if result == 0:
            open_ports.append(port)
        sock.close()
    return open_ports

host = "127.0.0.1"
open_ports = scan_ports(host)

print(f"Open ports on {host}: {open_ports}")
This script attempts to open a TCP connection to each port on the host from port 1 to 65534. If the connection succeeds, the port is considered open.

Please note:

This script is very basic and does not handle many edge cases and potential errors.
The timeout is set to 1 second, so this script can take a long time to run if it checks all 65534 ports. You might want to limit the range of ports it checks.
This script only checks TCP ports. A more advanced script might also check UDP ports.
Be aware of the legal and ethical issues involved in port scanning. You should only scan hosts that you have permission to scan.
Many hosts will have protections in place to detect and block port scans, so this script might not always work on all hosts.
