The function checks the password against several criteria:

The password must be at least 8 characters long.
The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
The password must contain at least one digit.
The password must contain at least one special character (one of !@#$%^&*()-+).
If the password passes all of these checks, the function returns the string "Password is valid". Otherwise, it returns a string describing the reason why the password is invalid.

In the example usage, we check the validity of the password "MyP@ssword123" by calling the password_checker function and printing the result to the console.

You can customize the password criteria by modifying the function's implementation. For example, you might want to require a longer or shorter password, or allow or disallow certain special characters.
